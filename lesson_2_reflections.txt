What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository a hidden directory named .git is
created containing the metadata for the new repository. You need that
directory and structure to maintain the history of the other files in
the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area unlike the working directory in that the files within
are committed to the repository when the commit command is issued.
The staging area offers an ability to review what is being saved before a commit
command is issued.
