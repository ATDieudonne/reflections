When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would think that you would want a remote repository if you knoew you needed to work
on the file while knowing that you wouldn't have access to your local machine. Another
instance you'd wan't to use a remote repository is when collaborating with other
contributors.
