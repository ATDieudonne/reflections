When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would think that you would want a remote repository if you knoew you needed to work
on the file while knowing that you wouldn't have access to your local machine. Another
instance you'd wan't to use a remote repository is when collaborating with other
contributors.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You always want to manually pull changes from the online repository to avoind pulling and
and adding unwanted changes to your files.  As there is no staging area (At least and easily
accessible one) on GitHub, anything you pull gets added without a change to review if it was
done automatically.  Furthermore your repository on GitHub might be public. If that is the
case then changes anyone would make would be automatically added to your local repository.
